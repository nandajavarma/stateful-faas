abstract = {Amazon Web Services unveiled their "Lambda" platform in late 2014. Since then, each of the major cloud computing infrastructure providers has released services supporting a similar style of deployment and operation, where rather than deploying and running monolithic services, or dedicated virtual machines, users are able to deploy individual functions, and pay only for the time that their code is actually executing. These technologies are gathered together under the marketing term "serverless" and the providers suggest that they have the potential to significantly change how client/server applications are designed, developed and operated. This paper presents two case industrial studies of early adopters, showing how migrating an application to the Lambda deployment architecture reduced hosting costs - by between 66% and 95% - and discusses how further adoption of this trend might influence common software architecture design practices.},

abstract = {Serverless computing (also known as functions as a service) is a new cloud computing abstraction that makes it easier to write robust, large-scale web services. In serverless computing, programmers write what are called serverless functions, which are programs that respond to external events. When demand for the serverless function spikes, the platform automatically allocates additional hardware and manages load-balancing; when demand falls, the platform silently deallocates idle resources; and when the platform detects a failure, it transparently retries affected requests. In 2014, Amazon Web Services introduced the first serverless platform, AWS Lambda, and similar abstractions are now available on all major cloud computing platforms. Unfortunately, the serverless computing abstraction exposes several low-level operational details that make it hard for programmers to write and reason about their code. This paper sheds light on this problem by presenting λλ, an operational semantics of the essence of serverless computing. Despite being a small (half a page) core calculus, λλ models all the low-level details that serverless functions can observe. To show that λλ is useful, we present three applications. First, to ease reasoning about code, we present a simplified naive semantics of serverless execution and precisely characterize when the naive semantics and λλ coincide. Second, we augment λλ with a key-value store to allow reasoning about stateful serverless functions. Third, since a handful of serverless platforms support serverless function composition, we show how to extend λλ with a composition language and show that our implementation can outperform prior work.},

abstract = {Serverless computing is increasingly popular because of the promise of lower cost and the convenience it provides to users who do not need to focus on server management. This has resulted in the availability of a number of proprietary and open-source serverless solutions. We seek to understand how the performance of serverless computing depends on a number of design issues using several popular open-source serverless platforms. We identify the idiosyncrasies affecting performance (throughput and latency) for different open-source serverless platforms. Further, we observe that just having either resource-based (CPU and memory) or workload-based (request per second (RPS) or concurrent requests) auto-scaling is inadequate to address the needs of the serverless platforms.},

abstract = {Serverless computing has gained attention due to its fine-grained provisioning, large-scale multi-tenancy, and on-demand scaling. However, it also forces applications to externalize state in remote storage, adding substantial overheads. To fix this "data shipping problem" we built Shredder, a low-latency multi-tenant cloud store that allows small units of computation to be performed directly within storage nodes. Storage tenants provide Shredder with JavaScript functions (or WebAssembly programs), which can interact directly with data without moving them over the network.The key challenge in Shredder is safely isolating thousands of tenant storage functions while minimizing data interaction costs. Shredder uses a unique approach where its data store and networking paths are implemented in native code to ensure performance, while isolated tenant functions interact with data using a V8-specific intermediate representation that avoids expensive cross-protection-domain calls and data copying. As a result, Shredder can execute 4 million remotely-invoked tenant functions per second spread over thousands of tenants with median and 99th-percentile response latencies of less than 50 μs and 500 μs, respectively. Our evaluation shows that Shredder achieves a 14% to 78% speedup against conventional remote storage when fetching items with just one to three data dependencies between them. We also demonstrate Shredder's effectiveness in accelerating data-intensive applications, including a k-hop query on social graphs that shows orders of magnitude gain.},
